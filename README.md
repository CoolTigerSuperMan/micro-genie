Common application libraries used in micro-service architectures, including libraries for publishing and subscribing to and from event topics, saving and reading to and from file stores, producing and consuming to and from queues, and basic Entity database persistence.  

The goal is to provide a library that enables fast development of micro-services by offering out of the box eventing, queuing, blob and database persistence. 


# Under Development

Micro Genie is currently under development in a non released stage

The APIs are not completed and will change. Sufficient test coverage does not exist and some methods are currently only stubbed out.
