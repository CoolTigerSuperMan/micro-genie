Common application libraries used in micro-service architectures, including libraries for publishing / subscribing to/from event topics, saving to file stores, producing and consuming to/from queues, and database persistence.  

Micro Genie also includes the ability to execute application commands asynchronously with dependency chaining (blocking until command results return) and passing outputs from one command as input to a chained / dependent command. 

The goal is to provide a library that enables fast development of micro-services by offering out of the box eventing, queuing, filestore persistence, and database persistence with optional asynchronous execution and command chaining. 



# Under Development

Micro Genie is currently under development in a non released stage

The APIs are not completed and will change. Sufficient test coverage does not exist and some methods are currently only stubbed out.
